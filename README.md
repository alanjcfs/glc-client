Game Lost Crash client.

OSX:

To run love2d from command line, use this command:

	open -n -a love <directory containing the main.lua file>

I would recommend to create an alias in .bash_profile because the above
command will open LOVE in the background, so all print() outputs will not be
visible on the console window.

Linux:

        love <directory>
